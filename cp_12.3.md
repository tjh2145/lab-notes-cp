getting out of the computer to remote hubs

**Server**
- client machine and remote machine
- Movement from hardware to software in the last few years
- Turing machine: has to be a physical process-something is writing and copying, but the Universal Turing Machine is an abstraction

**Creating servers as if they are software**
- Server used to be a metal box; plug in.
- Today the server is an abstraction - it is in the cloud. But it does have some materiality behind it.
- Servers are in themselves Turing machines - you can write servers and configure software

**Cloud Orchestration**
- spin up a hundred, a thousand servers
- make each server have a particular configuration
- Old way - reboot a system of computers for students to use; New way - orchestrate the servers to spin up the new software
- No longer just a System Administrator, but Dev Ops - responsible for the upkeep of the orchestra of servers

**Server**
- storage, brain, computer that hosts websites, serves information in real time, service, 
- Server/master dialectics
- not local, centralized location
- servers: streaming music, passing out docs/data. Not necessary to have hard copy of a song

**Progression of the 'server'**:
1. keyboard/terminal: basic, dumb computer that was essentially a server
2. Personal PC: computing locally
3. Last ten years - increasingly running on the server

*Servers run the world-government, music, media, Obamacare, stock market, etc*

- goal is to run our own servers, compute by yourself.
- it is a computer that is always on

####Create a virtual server
 **The Cloud**
 - cloud, or platform as a service. Instead of buying the server, buy the service
 - Amazon - aws; Microsoft; Google
 - Cloud virtualizes the components of what would be in the server
 - Server is an abstract entity. 
 - Depending on traffic, website requires bigger server
 - Amazon maintains the size of the server automatically depending on traffic

 **Ports in the server**
 - the port is 'listening' for http requests, and it then serves html pages through another port
 - port \/\/\/> port
 - **storage**: Amazon's harddrive is virtual
 - S3
 - EBS - 
 - Glacier - good for backups, harddrive that is inefficient
 - There are material harddrives, bunkers underground that take care of heating, cooling, climate control, under these servers
 - we don't have control of the material substratum, and Amazon is able to log into the server
 - Laptop, outside of the cloud, logs into the Amazon server, but the port could have a 'back door' opening for Amazon or others to log in
 - How comfortable are we with a private entity managing the infrastructure (storage database, server) of an organization?

 **Amazon**
 - selling infrastructure to governments is more profitable than selling merchandise to households
 - When Amazon was young, they used their server privately
 - PayPal - only working on payment, Amazon is now controlling every aspect

 - you can route your movement from a specific server to access different services (ex. instead of moving from China into the US, log into a remote server that is part of Columbia traffic to be routed through the US)

*Can we build architectures that support free speech, dissent, etc. online?*

**AWS**
1. EC2: an actual service, the heart of the cloud
2. Location: Oregon (default) - only hints to where your stuff is. Pick in North America, east coast --> N. Virginia.
- the components you spin up have to be in the same region (could cause problems in the future)
- **Limits**: limit your usage- bandwidth, privacy, etc.
- **Instances**: the different servers running
1. Launch Instance: free tier server - Ubuntu t-2 micro, free. **"Instance" = server** taking what used ot be steel, machine, server; now
2. clouds and 'instances'
2. Configure Instance Details: number = number of servers,
