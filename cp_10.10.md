-   **Uninstalling:** dependences and multiple files within the system

-   Brew installation: it is a linux/unix system

-   Firefox and MS Word use a window icon – when firefox uses version 1
    and ms word uses version 2, firefox can break. A smart system must
    be used to determine what files are still in use and which files are
    not. Programs install its own dependencies – dll (shared component
    of application).

-   In the linux/unix world, (linux comes in different flavors – Ubuntu,
    dabian, santos, etc. just like Windows 95, 98, etc.) Distribution
    maintains a repository of files, and figures out the dependencies in
    an external system, making sure that none of the dependencies break
    one another. More elegant, fixes dependency and security issues.

    -   In terminal: sudo aptitude install \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ draws
        into the global database of safe programs that are compatible

-   Solution for Mac: brew, which allows users to use “wget” command and
    it can do installations for you

-   Other repositories: pep for python. Repositories are central
    libraries

-   Installing outside of your system is dangerous and untrustable

**Search**: locate, find, grep, awk

**Network**: wget, curl, SSH, ping, traceroute

**Flow**: l \>\>, xargs

**Friend**: head, tail, cat

**Files and Extensions**

-   Wget: pull information from the internet (must install using brew,
    which brings you into an internet repository)

-   Head: shows first few lines of the text

-   Tail: shows the last few lines of the text

    -   Will be encrypted based on the file extension

-   Open: opens the entire file in the appropriate program

    -   “OS, do you know what to do with PDF…PDF Adobe Acrobat”

    -   %????1.5 = Adobe Acrobat

-   If you rename a file with a different extension, “No application
    knows how to open /Users/trinahyun/Documents/temp/blah.poo.”

    -   However, if you open it using adobe with a different extension,
        Adobe checks the opening lines to make sure the file is
        compatible

-   When you: echo “some stuff” \> Tietz\_Heidegger\_ccl.pdf

    -   It will overwrite the pdf encoding and Adobe will not be able to
        open it since it is a new file

    -   “some stuff” will now be in the text, and not the PDF encryption

-   Unix: create commands that do one thing well and give plaintext
    outputs

-   Use extensions seriously because the computer often tries to guess
    what program you need

    -   Pandoc –o: guess the file based on the extension

Search

-   Locate: find files.

    -   Locate is fast. Locate looks at the database of files in your
        system.

    -   Locate finds different files in my system. Why???

-   \*: remove everything with that name: “rm –ri test” (globbing)

-   Find: search through files, not just the database of files

-   Grep:

-   Awk:
