###11/19/14 GitHub continued

- What is your text, what is your source?
- Drafting versions are multiplying on a series of vectors while journaling and tracking your edits
- Remote - clobbering changes, with equal acces privileges

####Branching versions
- Example: v.5 create another branch; think about syllabi that cnage from year to year, working off of different versions
- Divergent branches can also converge again (complicated)
- one branch is called testing or development - in and out, not live, and when the testing reaches a stable point, merge it into your live version

####Remote & Local
**R1** <- -> **R2**

**L1**_____**L2**
- 2 remotes connected to each other, each remote is connected to a different local vector
- pull request, Git Hub has powerful tools to show the workflow/changes
- Experimental Methods (Dennis), Progamming Historian - these are editors that use pull requests

####Assignment: New repository - lab notes
push lab notes to repository and organize 

- set git editor to nano: git config --global core.editor nano
