###cd ~: shortcut for home
###bin

##Comments and Questions
- Unix syntax: transitive verb – adverb – object (ex. “give pencil” “give pencil violently”)
- Ls is a verb; object is implicit – ‘list the contents,’ ‘ls here’
- It gave commands a structure of the English language that makes sense; say out loud
- The object of every command is a path; everything is a path
- unix philosophy: bias towards plaintext data; it is portable and will work on any machine; it is sustainable. Under the cover of a PDF file is not human readable; only readable by Adobe.  Saving a particular file/format is a bet on a particular software.
- Plaintext: easy to reprocess and mine for information; good for digital humanists
- DRM: digital rights management field
- Encryption: restricts access
- Government should release easy ways to mine for information
- Commands are case sensitive
- If you save as .txt (plain text), you can look at a document in bash in readable language
- Yes, UNIX is human-readable, but only by those who understand the English alphabet. Who created UNIX, and how do people who use other languages use UNIX?  How was the invention of UNIX managed politically?  Who has the power to modify the language of Unix as technology advances?
- When you just input “cat” without a route, the language in the terminal just repeats itself. Why?
- Using the Terminal enables us to go “deeper” into the computer, but delving into different folders and locations.  How do we reach the “cloud” or the Internet? 
- In thinking about the surface and depth of my Macbook Air’s interface, I realize that I am using layers upon layers of text; I am immersed in the ‘superstructure’ of my computer and far removed from the ‘base’ which underlies the layers of interface.  But I make decisions using this interface. The base does not literally affect my ideas and creations on the computer.  To what extent am I independent from the deepest layer/language (unix) on my computer?
