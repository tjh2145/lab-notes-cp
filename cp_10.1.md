###UNIX Philosophy

-   One command that does things well. Produce plaintext data streams.

-   Mini – mining your own system, encrypt email, work with remote
    servers, grab data, etc.

###Danger

-   Cp, mv, rm

-   Why are there no contents listed when you are in Applications?

-   Touch: create blank file (touch test.txt)

-   Nano – plaintext editor in the terminal (nano test.txt)

###Operators

-   Echo: echoes to the screen (the screen is a vector)

-   Screen is one possible vector

-   Echo “hey guys” \> test.txt

-   Cat test.txt hey guys (appears in the terminal)

-   When you put in an additional message, “hello world”, it replaces
    the first entry

-   \> : overwrites the whole file

-   \>\> : appends the file (adds more information….see below)

```

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ echo "hey guys"

hey guys

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ echo "hey guys" \> test.txt

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ cat test.txt

hey guys

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ echo "hello world" \> test.txt

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ cat test.txt

hello world

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ echo "hey guys" \>\> test.txt

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ cat test.txt

hello world

hey guys

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ echo "hello again" \>\> test.txt

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$

dyn-160-39-132-162:temp trinahyun\$ cat test.txt

hello world

hey guys

hello again
```


-   **history:** shows what you’ve typed

-   | : pipes push data forward

-   **History | :** shows the commands; use j or k to move up and down

    -   To get out, press Q

-   History | less: Only shows commands

-   **Grep:** searches for any instances in the history of commands (ex.
    grep “hello” finds all instances where hello was used)

-   Ctrl R: reverse search through history

    -   Ctrl R and type in “hello” it finds first instance and all of
        the following instances

###Files

-   **Mkdir**

-   **Touch**

-   **Cp:** copy

    -   Cp target2.txt target3txt (copy target 2 to target 3)

    -   Spaces matter – command ends with space

    -   To ensure files work well across operating systems, best
        practice is not to use spaces because in UNIX, spaces matter for
        commands, and it makes it more difficult to distinguish with
        spaces

    -   Capitals matter as well. Don’t use capitals…but on Mac, it
        doesn’t recognize capitals so there will be a discrepancy when
        you send to a Linus machine.

        -   cp: Target3.txt and target3.txt are identical (not copied).

    -   Cp can overwrite files

-   **Mv:** move

    -   mv target3.txt .. : moves target3.txt to one directory up

-   **Rm:** remove

    -   rm –I target4.txt

-   Posix: syntax of the command: verb – flags (adverb, how) – noun
    (object or target of what you’re operating)

-   -i : ask for confirmation (GET IN THE HABIT OF USING –i with riskier
    commands)

    -   will ask for conformation y/n [n]

-   mkdir trash/ : make a trash directory (which is what the computer
    does for you on the interface)

-   ls –l : write things out in long format

    -   dyn-160-39-132-162:temp2 trinahyun\$ ls -l

    -   total 8

    -   -rw-r--r-- 1 trinahyun staff 12 Oct 1 12:19 target1.txt

    -   drwxr-xr-x 3 trinahyun staff 102 Oct 1 12:30 trash

-   verb adverb noun is always a path
```
cp target1.txt ../target1.txt = cp
    /Users/trinahyun/Documents/temp/temp2/target1.txt
    /Users/trinahyun/Documents/temp
```

-   rm –ri temp2/: remove recursively (combine flags) the files in and
    file directory- temp2

-   rm –r temp2 : remove temp2 completely

-   To be safe, create trash directory and MOVE instead of REMOVE: mv –i
    ../trash (etc….)

-   Wget: grab something online. Going to the network
