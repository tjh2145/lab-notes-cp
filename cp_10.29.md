pivotal: peer programming - always computing together
##Turing Machine

- negation machine: changes values A to !A until it is told to stop using knobs
- affirmation machine: leaves A as is; A=A
- states are direct: internal states, reads and writes to a tape

##Universal Turing Machine
- universal machine can take on the property of any other Turing Machine, or it can take on the state of any other machine 
- It is able to take in a machine
- can do both negation and affirmation

What is hardware and software?
- discrete states can rewrite itself
- no clear answer to the question

- Turing follows the hypothetical mode of thinking, inhereted from Wittgenstein
- "machine" that is "directly aware" - artificial intelligence? (2)
- Whatever is a part of the scanned square is part of the state: The m configuration
- "the configuration determines the possible behavior of the machine"
- main idea: it is a self re-writing machine. It is a machine that can rewrite its internal state
- 250: "The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his 'state of mind' at that moment."
- state of mind + internal state = configuration
- What is data? 

- bootstrapping: pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. booting up a computer - have to power up
- read-only memory is a tiny power in the machine that allows the contemporary machine to grow
- emulators - old nintendo on a modern computer

##Weasel Words
1. 3 papers from harddrive (long)
2. convert into plaintext
3. look up weasel words (very, clearly, absolutely) and search for these words in your writing, and replace (sed) the weasel words (with nothing)
4. corrected document and old document
5. data munging: destructive manipulation of data, to the point that you can no longer recover its original meaning. Every time you use sed, dump data into a new file (don't overwrite)
