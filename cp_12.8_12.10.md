##Pushing to the server
- EC2 Dashboard --> go to Instances
- Instances: servers made of hardware; matters of governance 
- Services (S3, EBS) are all connected to Amazon's central server


##Terminal - other tools (ping, traceroute)
- **ping**: ping google.com - we are sending 64 bytes into the server.
- google.com is human readable address
- **latency** how long does it take you to geta response back. Is it your computer or your browser?
- ping allows you to check the problem, if you are getting a signal into your machine, it means the internet is working
- **time**:
`
time=13.39ms
`
- the right speed (latency) for google - around 10 or 13. This number is the speed at which you're reaching the server
- **DNS** server which facilitates trip between different servers.
- **traceroute** google.com: shows the pathway to google - columbia > cogentco.com 
- Columbia is big/significant enough to connect directly to cogentco
- cogentco: tier 1, very high level, internet service provider. Owns the wires, owns the bandwidth
- tier 2: must lease the wires/bandwith

` * * * ` : Russian website masks the route, adds latency. Takes longer because you are going to Russia.

- large companies like renren.com (Chinese) that anticipates dense traffic will direct traffic through the US by investing in local companies/servers
- US exports server/packet sniffing technologies all over the world - one of our biggest exports

###pushing to the server using amazon aws
- **Description**: find the address in **Public DNS**
- address of the server: ec2-54-173-9-87.compute-1.amazonaws.com

###**ssh**: (awesome command) - Secure Shell
- email divided into different packets, sending to different addresses. 
- SSH allows a secured connection, encrypted as a whole rather than in packets(avoiding packet sniffing)
- Ex. if you are in China, you can create a tunnel through Columbia, which connects to Twitter, and can send the information through the tunnel
- DT: we are not doing computing in an empowered way. Like free speech, it comes with responsibilities, and it has a material substratum

**keys**: remember where you put your keys - you need the path
- path is everything

- go to the directory with keys -> Desktop
- **chmod gw-rwx** test.pem: change the permissions for the keys OR **chmod 600** test.pem
- 600 is another way of changing permissions
- **ssh -vi [pathway route] [public dns location]**: this opens up the path to the server

### Battle our way over the servers

###12/10/14 (extra cloud computing session)
## Getting on the Server

- opening thousands of ports in the server. This is yoru security policy. (eg. refuse all traffic from the internet=**cold storage**: you wouldnt put your bitcoin wallet on the internet)
- **hot**: plugged in, connected to internet
- AWS the larger cloud, there are also extra security ports
- Amazon has to connect us to the other server.
- We couldn't get in because by default, the security permissions are blocked
- DT's lab notes: DH Notes for "Launching an AWS instance"


**Get on the Server**
-*Missing step*: opening up the larger Amazon cloud (macro cloud which contains its commercial server)
- Security Groups (in AWS)
- Default
- Inbound (inbound traffic into the big cloud) -> Edit
- Add a Rule: SSH TCP 22 Anywhere
- Security Group: is a security manifest. Creating a security policy; it's a policy. 
- Associate different policies with different servers
- As soon as your server becomes a target, must be smart
- *Source: it will sa 0.0.0.0/0. We are saying accept all SSH traffic, opening a hole for SSH to come through, and we accept traffic from anywhere in the world to come through*

**Next step**
` ssh -vi /Users/trinahyun/Desktop/test.pem admin@ec2-54-173-9-87.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
- new user, new password (this is my server)
- Add the new user, delete the password protect, manage security preferences, add sudo group and delete default > ?

**Code to get on the server**:

```

```

- Now owner of a new machine, this is your own server.
- Use wget or curl to run large data/terabyte+

**Package Management**
- now in Ubuntu
- User preferences > install tools > sudo apt-get git-core (for example, this is the package manager for Ubuntu)
- zshell instead of bash allows you to use different colors in the terminal

**On your own - other commands**
1. **scp**:secure copy - take a big file and put it on your machine. cp is copy, scp is copy over ssh
2. **rsync**: sync a folder from local machine to remote server. Compare a folder and change the contents as needed.
3. **cron**: scheduler. daemon to execute scheduled commands. (ex. gov't releases data once a month on bicycle parking; retrieve from internet to local folder and sync folder to remote. cron allows you to run a script once a month to sync information)

**SPACE**
- our machine we spun up on amazon's server has a cpu and a tiny hard drive. Don't save on the hard drive, it's ephemeral if you stop the server and run it again
- AWS has three other conceptual hard drives (outside of its main server): S3 like dropbox, EBS buying a hard drive, Glacier is for backup - not live.
- **Elastic Blocks** on AWS dashboard - mount extra blocks
- Dev op: write a script (python library that deals with AWS) - for the ways you want to back up information
- Works like dropbox, cheaper because there is no middle man.

**Extra notes**
- Volumes - create snapshot - give access to another person who can mount the volume to another server
- Amazon Public Data Sets - massive collections of websites to share online

- Website hosting is most likely through Amazon
- Chinese government tests every website on Amazon
- Security policies and hardening. Cloud leaves you vulnerable
- Spam: runs through the cloud computing. Amazon does police to a certain extent; data can be shared with FBI and CIA

- Abstracted away from metal - hard drive is just a piece of code in the cloud/server
- Docker, just scripting, reduce images to small programs which has five lines of code > runs in the cloud and the system is built for you, reduced to code
- dream of the universal machine is coming true - everything is abstracted from you
- Running Linux locally is applicable to everywhere else
