##Versions, drafts
model 1 (traditional): one document, simultaneous editing sent to different people

model 2: one document that is circulated around sequentially

model 3: **git**: major way people collaborate online

###Git
- keeping a journal, adding to your workflow; on top of the work you do, you keep a journal of what you do
- folder is a vector, it evolves
- Document (lives in some folder) 
- at every step, you're losing the work of older versions and you only have the latest version
- **file system (fs)** is a vector: -- v1 -- v2 -- v3 --> 
- stage (bring a file(s) to a stage to work on it)
- **stage**: --v1+v2---v3+v4--->
- **journal** (commit the staged version to the journal)
- --v1+v2=**v1**--v3+v4=**v2**-->
- *this is all local on your machine* 

- **visibility of labor**: git allows one to show the work you have done.

###Git commands
- **gitinit**: file system
- **gitadd**: stage
- **gitcommit**: journal 

- **gitpush** --> *remote server:* **github**
- journal is now on remote server/cloud ------->
- **gitpull** pull down everything from remote server

- when remote is ahead of you (someone changed another version in github), git will tell you, so you must sync your journal document with the remote document
- trying to solve the multiplicity of copies

#Git
- show hidden files: ls -a
- shows the hidden files created: .	..	.git
- **git status**: mr. git, what is happening in this folder. Git says right now that there is ntohing to commit
- git knows when a new file is created
- **git add**: we aded test.txt to the stage
- git status: 

```
Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   test.txt
```

- what happens when you stage a file after you stage it?
- takes the changes you made within a certain moment, actively creating versions

- **git remote add origin**
- first time you push: **git push -u origin master**
- prompts you for username/pw
- **DO NOT PUT YOUR GIT DIRECTORY IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY, BECAUSE IT WILL ADD EVERYTHING TO GITHUB IF YOU ARE PUSHING**
- tell git git remote origin https://github.com/tjh2145/lab-notes-cp.git 

- git add: stage
- git commit: journal
- git push: push to remote 
- git checkout test2.txt: reverts back to the last version
- **must use plaintext**: cannot use binary files 
- using terminal allows you to access more complicated commands, and if anything breaks, the terminal must be used to fix it.
- version controlling the source
- Programming Historian uses this system to create publications
- diff: compare old files with new files
- plaintext: you can engineer on top of plaintext, good for coauthoring
- **blame**: shows who is responsible for different lines
