**Final Assignment:** pick one topic that you care about and create a tutorial
- always start with a statement of what's at stake, why it's important

####GitHub Pull Request

**Forking and Pull Request**
- make an exact copy of another repository on your github account.
- this creates full permissions 
- **diff** compare the changes
- if acceptable, click **merge** and it incorporates the changes into the original
- **this pull request peer production model is important because it accepts that each part is modular, and it is easier to put together the collective project**
- most collective projects have strong barriers of entry, but this model allows taking a piece that will eventually be reviewed 
- every software company in the world uses a peer production software like GitHub for version control
- Git is popular because it is similar

- Fork, edit, push, and add to the master repository

####Access and file permissions

- multiple users on the same machine/server there are many issues with security
- **user management**: all in the same environment 
- *rise of the personal computer*
- we are moving into the cloud, a centralized system for computing. eg. using gmail is like using the cloud. Google has access to the entire system
- centralized system means giving up complete ownership, compromise privacy

####How it works
- machine: sign up for a new account. 
- Users are baked into your computer.

- Go to home:
`ls -l`
- shows you all of the files and sizes in the home folder and the **permissions**
```

```
- Next step:`id trinahyun`
- shows you all of the groups of which you are a part
- rwx | rwx | rwx
- user | group | world
- r, read; w, write; x, execute
- If you want to give your group right permissions

```
chmod g+w test.txt
```
- give write permission to g, group

``` 
chmod u-w test.txt 
```
- take away write permissions away from u, user
- hacking: all servers have a remote login by stealing an employee password. Administrator on the server. Change employee privileges to administrator privileges
- email, credit cards are stored in a the **sudo** system

- NOTE: when you go to route, all of the files belong to admin or wheel. in the home folder, everything belongs to me.
- system administrator holds the keys to the entire operation
