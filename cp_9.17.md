##Pandoc and Markdown: Introduction

-   Tactile feel of textuality in these workshops

-   Form and formatting content; distinction between content and form

-   Decisions have political implications (Heidegger & Winner), not just
    janitorial work for computation. Phenomenological implications –
    changes the way you think

-   Enframing this world. Instrumentality as an extension of your brain,
    even though it’s literally an extension of your hand

**Text in your daily life**

-   Managerial problem – organization. The way we organize affects the
    way it is published (Marxist superstructure phenomenon, access to
    knowledge, knowledge production) Superstructural problems

-   Finger computer readership (and the opposite way)

-   Documents as lines/points - vectors

    -   Document travels in space and time (these are not individual
        points, but vectors)

    -   Indeterminacy of a document – textual criticism, difficult to
        know when a text is finished; multiplicity of versions,
        canonical or not; amorphous, changing through shape and time

    -   What is the content of the poem if it is shifting? It is never
        done; it is always change

-   Email is a vector, term paper is a vector, amazon ebooks,

    -   How do you back them up? How do you share? How do you organize?
        Ecosystems have different affordances

    -   Encryption: parallel vectors to be in control of vectors

-   Problems:

    -   The birth of an idea: using a proprietary format. Technological
        path has different affordances. Map out (anthropological study)
        of textual objects that surround us.

        -   Disparity and entanglement of vectors

    -   Access, search, encryption, sending, back-up

    -   Search across all documents

    -   Google will take care of these things – uncomfortable
        proposition to completely cede control

-   Solution: Take the starting point of all vectors (documents)

-   Textual world – computer (The Universal Machine) Definition: a
    machine that can emulate any other machine

    -   Human readable – encoded – not readable, but floating around

    -   Frees us from the confines of the material.

    -   Beneath: the symbolic language, logic, culture touching the
        deepest layer

    -   Free and open software movement

    -   Ownership – if you don’t own the hardware

    -   Evan Moglan? (Columbia)

-   Perhaps this should be taught in school earlier on.

-   Physical layer (how deep does this go) and the metaphysical

-   Unify different ecosystems and technological affordances

    -   Make all files in plaintext (underneath, there is a way to
        combine all files in this language)

    -   As much as possible, the dream is to unify the origin points of
        the vectors in plaintext, non-proprietary,

    -   Easy to “vectorize” – send, make books,

-   Winner: look at the purchase of technology as a political decision

-   Force to vectorize along pathways not of your own choosing (eg.
    Using Word to publish articles in journals, since they only accept
    those)

-   Difference between a physical harddrive and the cloud – how
    different is this? Entrusting your vectors to technologies

-   Is plaintext apolitical? Not necessarily, but offers more freedom
    for decisions. Sometimes enables forms of politics

-   Espionage act, enigma project

-   History of encryption is related to military technology

-   Born in plaintext, and using programs (PDF, Word) to become vectors

-   The Cloud – is it surface? Deep?

**Pandoc and Markdown**

-   Form and content: idea = content, published form/format = form

-   Separating form and content gives you freedom

-   Microsoft Word: form and content are one in the same. Write and
    format at the same time – italics, ex.

    -   What you see is what you get

-   But there is a markup underneath. Formatting has to be embedded
    underneath content. So what you see is not what you get; the
    software is hiding what is actually in (under) the document

-   Printer: actually flattens form and content; but the only thing that
    actually understands Word is Word

-   \*\*Practice how to pull up document in the terminal to see the
    mark-up

-   Professional typesetters strip down Microsoft Word for published
    books

-   Why are we so concerned with formatting the page?

-   We are going to separate form and content. Frees you from the
    inefficiency

-   Acculturated habits of needing form and content together on
    Microsoft Word

HTML

-   Human readable. Aristotelian vison

-   History of Word Processor

    -   .doc -\> .doc

    -   xml: extensible markup language (can be used to mark up other
        things) – used to answer criticism about Microsoft’s language

    -   xml: tags

    -   Limit to language – doesn’t identify every molecule, but select
        what is important to you

-   HTML: separate form and content, semantics

    -   Paragraph: a semantic structure and can be formatted in many
        ways. What the paragraph looks like is different in different
        layouts.

-   CSS – deciding how paragraphs should start, defining in a different
    layer. There is another agent

-   Form, content, formatting

-   What is bold/italic/frilly: formatting (aesthetics). Why we use
    italics – emphasis direct speech, foreign words why not have a word
    called “emphasis” and we make the decision of how to show that –
    bold, italics, etc.

    -   Who makes these decisions of layers – bold vs. “emphasis”
        description that affects our decisions on format

-   Problems

    -   Gunky, not human-readable

    -   Semantics, style and content

-   Who decides form, html – conventions from antiquity – history of
    paragraph, footnote

    -   Governing body – contentious

    -   Implications

-   Markdown

    -   Daring fireball (website – research), aaron Schwartz – inventing
        markdown

    -   Became widely used tool

    -   Reddit, Wikipedia, almost all web interfaces accept markdown
